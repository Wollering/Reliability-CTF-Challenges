## Challenge Overview

"The Single-Point Failure" is a beginner-level AWS reliability challenge focusing on high availability and disaster recovery. Participants must improve a single-region voting application (QuickPoll) to make it resilient against regional failures.

The challenge simulates a real-world scenario where a company experienced a complete outage due to an AWS regional service issue. Participants need to implement multi-region redundancy while ensuring data consistency and minimal disruption during failovers.

## Learning Objectives

This challenge teaches participants to:

- Design and implement multi-region deployment strategies
- Configure cross-region data replication with DynamoDB Global Tables
- Set up health checks and failover routing with Route 53
- Implement CloudFront origin failover for frontend resilience
- Create cross-region monitoring and alerting systems
- Test and validate end-to-end failover procedures

## Architecture Design

### Current (Unreliable) Architecture

The starting architecture deliberately includes several reliability weaknesses:

- Single-region deployment in us-east-1
- Frontend: Single S3 bucket with CloudFront distribution (no origin failover)
- API: Lambda functions in a single region
- Database: DynamoDB table without global tables or PITR
- No health checks or failover routing
- No cross-region monitoring or alerting

This architecture is vulnerable to regional outages, representing a common mistake in cloud architecture.

### Target (Reliable) Architecture

The target architecture participants should implement includes:

- Multi-region deployment across us-east-1 and us-west-2
- Frontend: Multiple S3 buckets with CloudFront origin failover
- API: Lambda functions and API Gateway deployed in multiple regions
- Database: DynamoDB global tables with point-in-time recovery
- Route 53 health checks monitoring regional endpoints
- Route 53 failover routing policies for automatic traffic redirection
- CloudWatch cross-region dashboards and alarms

## Implementation Steps

### Setting Up the Environment

First, we need to create the necessary AWS resources and scripts for the challenge:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# setup_environment.py

import boto3
import json
import uuid
import time

def setup_environment():
    """Set up the required AWS resources for the challenge"""
    print("Setting up environment for 'The Single-Point Failure' challenge...")
    
    # Create challenge bucket for storing templates and scripts
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    challenge_bucket = f"single-point-failure-challenge-{int(time.time())}"
    
    try:
        s3.create_bucket(Bucket=challenge_bucket)
        print(f"Created challenge bucket: {challenge_bucket}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error creating bucket: {e}")
        return None
    
    # Create DynamoDB table for tracking participants
    dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
    table_name = "single-point-failure-participants"
    
    try:
        table = dynamodb.create_table(
            TableName=table_name,
            KeySchema=[
                {'AttributeName': 'participantId', 'KeyType': 'HASH'}
            ],
            AttributeDefinitions=[
                {'AttributeName': 'participantId', 'AttributeType': 'S'}
            ],
            ProvisionedThroughput={'ReadCapacityUnits': 5, 'WriteCapacityUnits': 5}
        )
        # Wait for table creation
        table.meta.client.get_waiter('table_exists').wait(TableName=table_name)
        print(f"Created DynamoDB table: {table_name}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error creating DynamoDB table: {e}")
    
    # Return resource names
    return {
        "challenge_bucket": challenge_bucket,
        "participant_table": table_name
    }

if __name__ == "__main__":
    resources = setup_environment()
    if resources:
        with open("challenge_resources.json", "w") as f:
            json.dump(resources, f, indent=2)
        print("Environment setup complete!")
```

### Creating the Base Template

Create the CloudFormation template for the unreliable application:

```python
# generate_base_template.py

def generate_base_template(participant_id):
    """Generate the unreliable base CloudFormation template"""
    
    template = {
        "AWSTemplateFormatVersion": "2010-09-09",
        "Description": "CTF Challenge - The Single-Point Failure (Unreliable Starting Point)",
        "Parameters": {
            "ParticipantId": {
                "Type": "String",
                "Default": participant_id,
                "Description": "Unique identifier for the participant"
            }
        },
        "Resources": {
            # DynamoDB Table (without global tables)
            "PollsTable": {
                "Type": "AWS::DynamoDB::Table",
                "Properties": {
                    "TableName": f"quickpoll-{participant_id}",
                    "BillingMode": "PAY_PER_REQUEST",
                    "KeySchema": [
                        {"AttributeName": "pollId", "KeyType": "HASH"},
                        {"AttributeName": "timestamp", "KeyType": "RANGE"}
                    ],
                    "AttributeDefinitions": [
                        {"AttributeName": "pollId", "AttributeType": "S"},
                        {"AttributeName": "timestamp", "AttributeType": "N"}
                    ]
                    # Missing: Point-in-time recovery
                    # Missing: Global table configuration
                }
            },
            
            # S3 Bucket for Website (single region)
            "WebsiteBucket": {
                "Type": "AWS::S3::Bucket",
                "Properties": {
                    "BucketName": f"quickpoll-website-{participant_id}",
                    "WebsiteConfiguration": {
                        "IndexDocument": "index.html",
                        "ErrorDocument": "error.html"
                    }
                    # Missing: Cross-region replication
                }
            },
            
            # Lambda Functions and API Gateway in a single region
            # (Details omitted for brevity but would include the complete Lambda functions)
        },
        
        "Outputs": {
            # Output values for the deployment
        }
    }
    
    return template
```

### Deploying for Participants

Create a deployment script to create a unique instance for each participant:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# deploy_for_participant.py

import boto3
import json
import uuid
import subprocess
from generate_base_template import generate_base_template

def deploy_for_participant(participant_id=None):
    """Deploy a unique instance for each participant"""
    
    # Generate participant ID if not provided
    if not participant_id:
        participant_id = f"participant-{uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]}"
    
    print(f"Deploying for participant: {participant_id}")
    
    # Generate template
    template = generate_base_template(participant_id)
    template_file = f"template-{participant_id}.json"
    
    with open(template_file, "w") as f:
        json.dump(template, f, indent=2)
    
    # Create stack name
    stack_name = f"single-point-failure-{participant_id}"
    
    # Deploy CloudFormation template
    cmd = [
        "aws", "cloudformation", "deploy",
        "--template-file", template_file,
        "--stack-name", stack_name,
        "--parameter-overrides", f"ParticipantId={participant_id}",
        "--capabilities", "CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM"
    ]
    
    try:
        subprocess.run(cmd, check=True)
        print(f"Deployment complete: {stack_name}")
        
        # Store participant info in DynamoDB
        dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
        table = dynamodb.Table("single-point-failure-participants")
        
        # Get stack outputs
        cloudformation = boto3.client('cloudformation')
        response = cloudformation.describe_stacks(StackName=stack_name)
        outputs = {
            output["OutputKey"]: output["OutputValue"] 
            for output in response["Stacks"][0]["Outputs"]
        }
        
        # Store in DynamoDB
        table.put_item(
            Item={
                "participantId": participant_id,
                "stackName": stack_name,
                "deployedAt": int(boto3.client('sts').get_caller_identity()["Account"]),
                "endpoints": outputs
            }
        )
        
        return stack_name, outputs
    
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Deployment failed: {e}")
        return None, None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    participant_id = sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv) > 1 else None
    stack_name, outputs = deploy_for_participant(participant_id)
    
    if stack_name:
        print(f"Challenge deployed successfully for: {participant_id}")
        print("Endpoints:")
        for key, value in outputs.items():
            print(f"  {key}: {value}")
```

## Assessment Engine

The assessment engine evaluates participants' solutions by checking for specific reliability improvements.

### Check Functions

Here are examples of check functions for evaluating key reliability patterns:

```python
# check_functions.py

async def check_multi_region_frontend(participant_id, stack_name, credentials=None):
    """Check if frontend is deployed in multiple regions with failover"""
    
    # Create boto3 session with credentials if provided
    session = boto3.Session(
        aws_access_key_id=credentials.get('aws_access_key_id') if credentials else None,
        aws_secret_access_key=credentials.get('aws_secret_access_key') if credentials else None,
        aws_session_token=credentials.get('aws_session_token') if credentials else None
    ) if credentials else boto3.Session()
    
    s3 = session.client('s3')
    cloudfront = session.client('cloudfront')
    
    # Check for S3 buckets in multiple regions
    response = s3.list_buckets()
    participant_buckets = [
        bucket for bucket in response['Buckets'] 
        if f"quickpoll-website-{participant_id}" in bucket['Name']
    ]
    
    # Check bucket locations
    regions = set()
    for bucket in participant_buckets:
        try:
            location = s3.get_bucket_location(Bucket=bucket['Name'])
            region = location['LocationConstraint'] or 'us-east-1'  # us-east-1 returns None
            regions.add(region)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error checking bucket location: {e}")
    
    # Check CloudFront for origin failover
    distributions = cloudfront.list_distributions()['DistributionList'].get('Items', [])
    has_failover = False
    
    for dist in distributions:
        if participant_id in dist.get('Comment', ''):
            config = cloudfront.get_distribution_config(Id=dist['Id'])
            if 'OriginGroups' in config['DistributionConfig']:
                if config['DistributionConfig']['OriginGroups'].get('Quantity', 0) > 0:
                    has_failover = True
    
    return {
        "implemented": len(regions) > 1 and has_failover,
        "details": {
            "regions": list(regions),
            "bucketCount": len(participant_buckets),
            "hasFailover": has_failover
        }
    }

async def check_dynamodb_global_tables(participant_id, stack_name, credentials=None):
    """Check if DynamoDB global tables are implemented"""
    
    # Similar implementation pattern as above
    # Check for global tables and point-in-time recovery
    
    return {
        "implemented": has_global_tables and has_pitr,
        "details": {
            "globalTables": global_tables,
            "tableRegions": regions_per_table,
            "hasPITR": has_pitr
        }
    }

# Additional check functions for other criteria
```

### Scoring Logic

Implement scoring logic to calculate the overall reliability score:

```python
# scoring_logic.py

def calculate_reliability_score(assessment_results):
    """Calculate weighted reliability score based on assessment results"""
    
    # Define category weights
    weights = {
        "frontend": 0.15,  # Frontend components
        "backend": 0.25,   # Backend and data components
        "routing": 0.25,   # Traffic routing and DNS
        "testing": 0.15,   # Testing and validation
        "monitoring": 0.20  # Monitoring and alerting
    }
    
    # Map criteria to categories
    criteria_categories = {
        "multi-region-frontend": "frontend",
        "cloudfront-origin-failover": "frontend",
        "dynamodb-global-tables": "backend",
        "multi-region-lambda": "backend",
        "route53-health-checks": "routing",
        "route53-failover-routing": "routing",
        "cross-region-monitoring": "monitoring",
        "end-to-end-failover": "testing"
    }
    
    # Calculate category scores and apply weights
    # (Details omitted for brevity)
    
    return total_score
```

### Feedback Generation

Generate educational feedback based on assessment results:

```python
# feedback_generator.py

def generate_feedback(assessment_results, reliability_score):
    """Generate educational feedback for participants"""
    
    feedback = {
        "score": reliability_score,
        "passed": reliability_score >= 80,
        "summary": "",
        "implemented": [],
        "suggestions": []
    }
    
    # Generate summary based on score
    if reliability_score >= 90:
        feedback["summary"] = "Excellent job! Your solution demonstrates a thorough understanding of multi-region resilience principles."
    elif reliability_score >= 80:
        feedback["summary"] = "Good work! Your solution successfully implements key multi-region resilience patterns."
    elif reliability_score >= 60:
        feedback["summary"] = "You've made good progress, but the application still has some vulnerabilities to regional failures."
    else:
        feedback["summary"] = "Your application needs more resilience improvements to protect against regional failures."
    
    # Add detailed feedback for each criterion
    for result in assessment_results:
        # (Details omitted for brevity)
        pass
    
    # Add learning resources
    feedback["learning_resources"] = [
        {
            "title": "AWS Multiple Region Architecture",
            "url": "https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/multi-region-application-architecture/"
        },
        # Additional resources
    ]
    
    return feedback
```

## Testing the Challenge

Create a test script to verify the challenge functions correctly:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# test_challenge.py

import asyncio
from assess_challenge import assess_challenge

async def test_challenge():
    """Test the challenge assessment with different scenarios"""
    
    # Test with a basic deployment (should score low)
    participant_id = "test-basic"
    print(f"Testing basic deployment for {participant_id}")
    result = await assess_challenge(participant_id)
    print(f"Basic score: {result['score']}/100 (Expected low score)")
    
    # Test with a partial implementation
    participant_id = "test-partial"
    print(f"Testing partial implementation for {participant_id}")
    result = await assess_challenge(participant_id)
    print(f"Partial score: {result['score']}/100 (Expected medium score)")
    
    # Test with a complete implementation
    participant_id = "test-complete"
    print(f"Testing complete implementation for {participant_id}")
    result = await assess_challenge(participant_id)
    print(f"Complete score: {result['score']}/100 (Expected high score)")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(test_challenge())
```

## Integration with CTF Platform

To integrate this challenge with the Dynamic Challenge Assessment Engine:

1. Store challenge configuration in S3:
   ```json
   {
     "challengeId": "single-point-failure",
     "name": "The Single-Point Failure",
     "description": "Improve a single-region application to be resilient against regional failures",
     "assessmentCriteria": [
       {
         "id": "multi-region-frontend",
         "name": "Multi-Region Frontend Deployment",
         "points": 10,
         "checkFunction": "check_multi_region_frontend"
       },
       // Additional criteria
     ]
   }
   ```

2. Register the challenge in the DynamoDB registry:
   ```python
   def register_challenge():
       """Register the challenge in the CTF platform"""
       dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
       table = dynamodb.Table('ctf-challenge-registry')
       
       item = {
           'challengeId': 'single-point-failure',
           'name': 'The Single-Point Failure',
           'description': 'Improve a single-region application to be resilient against regional failures',
           's3Location': 's3://ctf-reliability-challenges/single-point-failure/',
           'configFile': 'config.json',
           'checkFunctionsFile': 'check-functions.py',
           'difficulty': 'beginner',
           'active': 'true',
           'createdBy': 'admin',
           'createdAt': datetime.now().isoformat()
       }
       
       table.put_item(Item=item)
   ```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues participants might encounter:

1. **IAM Permissions**: Ensure participants have necessary permissions to create resources across multiple regions.

2. **DynamoDB Global Tables**: If participants encounter errors creating global tables, check that:
   - Tables in different regions have identical schemas
   - All regions are enabled for global tables
   - Streams are enabled with the correct view type

3. **Route 53 Configuration**: Health checks might not work correctly if:
   - Endpoints aren't publicly accessible
   - Health check parameters are too strict

4. **Assessment Issues**: If the assessment engine fails to detect implemented patterns:
   - Verify resources have correct naming patterns
   - Check for typos in resource names
   - Ensure resources are in the expected regions

## Advanced Considerations

For more advanced implementations:

1. **Cost Optimization**: 
   - Use CloudFront price class 100 during testing
   - Be mindful of inter-region data transfer costs

2. **Consistent Failover Experience**:
   - Consider session handling during failover
   - Implement client-side retry logic

3. **Enhanced Resilience**:
   - Add multi-AZ deployments within each region
   - Implement circuit breakers for API calls
   - Use SQS queues for asynchronous operations

4. **Security Considerations**:
   - Apply proper IAM roles and policies across regions
   - Ensure encryption for data at rest and in transit
   - Configure WAF and Shield for DDoS protection

By implementing this challenge, you'll provide participants with hands-on experience building multi-region applications following AWS reliability best practices. The progressive scoring system encourages incremental improvements and learning throughout the challenge.
