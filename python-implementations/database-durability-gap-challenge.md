## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive step-by-step implementation guide for the "Database Durability Gap" challenge from the AWS Well-Architected Reliability Pillar CTF event. This beginner-level challenge focuses on backup and recovery strategies for AWS databases, particularly addressing the vulnerability of a DynamoDB table without proper backup mechanisms enabled.

## Challenge Design Process

### Define Learning Objectives

First, we need to establish clear learning objectives for participants:

```
Learning objectives:
- Understand AWS database backup strategies and best practices
- Implement point-in-time recovery for DynamoDB tables
- Configure automated backups with appropriate retention periods
- Set up backup monitoring and alerting
- Design disaster recovery procedures for database data
- Implement backup testing and validation mechanisms
```

### Choose Reliability Focus Areas

For this challenge, we'll focus on these specific reliability patterns from the AWS Well-Architected Framework:

- Data Backup and Recovery
- Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)
- Backup Retention Policies
- Backup Monitoring and Alerting
- Backup Testing and Validation
- Cross-Region Backup Strategies

### Design the Challenge Scenario

Let's create a realistic scenario that puts the focus on database durability:

```
Scenario: "Database Durability Gap"

You've been hired as a reliability engineer for TicketMaster, a small but growing event ticketing platform. Last week, the company experienced a critical incident: an accidental DELETE operation was executed against their production DynamoDB table that stores all customer ticket data. Without proper backup mechanisms in place, they lost a significant amount of data and had to manually recover information from third-party systems and customer emails.

The CTO has tasked you with implementing proper backup and recovery strategies to ensure this never happens again. You need to make the database resilient against accidental deletion, corruption, and other data loss scenarios while ensuring compliance with the company's 7-year data retention requirement.
```

## Documenting the Architecture

### Document the Current (Unreliable) Architecture

Let's detail the existing architecture and highlight its reliability issues:

```
Current Architecture (Unreliable):

- Primary database: DynamoDB table "ticket-transactions"
  - Stores all ticket purchase data, customer information, and event details
  - No point-in-time recovery enabled
  - No automated backups configured
  - No backup monitoring or alerting
  - No documented recovery procedures

- API Layer:
  - Lambda functions that read/write to the DynamoDB table
  - No data validation before write operations
  - No protection against mass update/delete operations

- Monitoring:
  - Basic CloudWatch metrics for DynamoDB capacity usage
  - No specific monitoring for database operations or backup status

Known issues:
- Vulnerable to accidental data deletion or corruption
- No way to restore the database to a previous point in time
- No automated backup process
- No backup testing or validation
- No cross-region backup strategy
- Poor monitoring of critical database operations
```

### Document the Target (Reliable) Architecture

Now, let's define the ideal architecture that resolves all reliability issues:

```
Target Architecture (Reliable):

- Enhanced Primary Database:
  - DynamoDB table with point-in-time recovery (PITR) enabled
  - AWS Backup plan with appropriate retention schedule
  - Cross-region backup strategy for disaster recovery
  
- Protection Mechanisms:
  - IAM policies to restrict risky operations
  - Condition checks for critical update/delete operations
  - Soft delete implementation for recoverable deletion

- Enhanced Monitoring:
  - CloudWatch Alarms for unusual data operations
  - AWS Backup notifications for backup events
  - Automated backup testing and validation
  - Dashboard for backup status and recovery point objectives

Reliability improvements:
[15 pts] Point-in-time recovery enabled on DynamoDB table
[15 pts] AWS Backup plan with appropriate retention policy
[10 pts] Cross-region backup implementation
[15 pts] Database operation monitoring and alerting
[10 pts] IAM policies to prevent unintended data manipulation
[10 pts] Soft delete implementation for data protection
[15 pts] Backup testing and validation mechanism
[10 pts] Documented recovery procedures
```

## Implementation with CloudFormation

### Base Template (Unreliable Application)

For the unreliable base template, we'll create a Python script that generates a CloudFormation template with the following components:

1. A DynamoDB table without point-in-time recovery or backup configurations
2. Lambda functions with no data protection mechanisms (using hard deletes)
3. Overly permissive IAM policies
4. API Gateway endpoints for creating and deleting tickets
5. A special "bulk delete" operation with no safeguards

The full implementation is provided in the `generate_unreliable_template.py` file.

### Deployment Script

The deployment script (`deploy_challenge.py`) will:

1. Generate the CloudFormation template with a unique participant ID
2. Deploy the template to AWS
3. Seed the DynamoDB table with sample ticket transaction data
4. Return the deployed stack information and API endpoints

### Reference Solution Template

The reference solution template (for instructor use only) demonstrates all the required reliability improvements:

1. DynamoDB table with point-in-time recovery enabled
2. AWS Backup plan with daily, weekly, and yearly backup rules
3. Cross-region backup configuration
4. Proper IAM policies with least privilege
5. Lambda functions with soft delete implementation
6. Backup validation and testing mechanisms
7. CloudWatch alarms for monitoring database operations
8. SNS notifications for backup events

## Setting Up the Assessment Engine

### Configure the Assessment Engine

For this challenge, we'll create a configuration file that defines the assessment criteria and scoring:

```python
# database_durability_challenge_config.py
challenge_config = {
    "challenge_id": "database-durability-gap",
    "name": "Database Durability Gap",
    "description": "Implement proper backup strategies for a critical database",
    "stack_name_prefix": "database-durability-gap-",
    "assessment_criteria": [
        {
            "id": "point-in-time-recovery",
            "name": "Point-in-Time Recovery",
            "points": 15,
            "check_function": "check_point_in_time_recovery",
            "description": "Enable point-in-time recovery on the DynamoDB table",
            "suggestion": "Configure PointInTimeRecoverySpecification with PointInTimeRecoveryEnabled set to true"
        },
        # Additional criteria defined here...
    ],
    "passing_score": 75
}
```

### Implement Check Functions

We'll implement a series of check functions to evaluate each aspect of the solution:

1. `check_point_in_time_recovery`: Verifies that PITR is enabled on the DynamoDB table
2. `check_aws_backup_plan`: Checks for an AWS Backup plan with appropriate retention policies
3. `check_cross_region_backup`: Verifies cross-region backup implementation
4. `check_database_monitoring`: Checks for CloudWatch alarms on database operations
5. `check_iam_policies`: Validates that IAM policies follow least privilege principles
6. `check_soft_delete`: Confirms that soft delete is implemented instead of hard delete
7. `check_backup_testing`: Validates that backup testing mechanisms are in place
8. `check_recovery_procedures`: Checks for documented recovery procedures

Each check function returns a result with an `implemented` boolean and `details` object.

## Scoring Methodology

### Scoring Logic

The scoring logic calculates a weighted score based on the implemented criteria:

```python
def calculate_backup_score(assessment_results):
    """Calculate a weighted score based on assessment results for the backup challenge"""
    # Define category weights
    weights = {
        "backup_mechanisms": 0.35,  # Core backup mechanisms
        "data_protection": 0.25,    # Data protection strategies
        "monitoring": 0.20,         # Monitoring and alerting
        "procedures": 0.20          # Testing and procedures
    }
    
    # Map criteria to categories
    criteria_categories = {
        "point-in-time-recovery": "backup_mechanisms",
        "aws-backup-plan": "backup_mechanisms",
        "cross-region-backup": "backup_mechanisms",
        "database-monitoring": "monitoring",
        "iam-policies": "data_protection",
        "soft-delete": "data_protection",
        "backup-testing": "procedures",
        "recovery-procedures": "procedures"
    }
    
    # Calculate category scores and apply weights
    # ...
    
    return round(total_score)
```

### Feedback Generator

The feedback generator creates educational feedback based on the assessment results:

```python
def generate_feedback(assessment_results, backup_score):
    """Generate educational feedback based on assessment results"""
    
    # Initialize feedback structure
    feedback = {
        "score": backup_score,
        "passed": backup_score >= 75,
        "summary": "",
        "implemented": [],
        "suggestions": []
    }
    
    # Generate summary message based on score
    # ...
    
    # Add detailed feedback for each assessment criterion
    # ...
    
    # Add educational resources
    # ...
    
    return feedback
```
